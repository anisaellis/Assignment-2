	<h1> First Generation</h1>
	<p> In the history of video games, the first generation era refers to the video games, video game consoles, and handheld video game consoles available from 1972 to 1983. 
	Notable consoles of the first generation include the Odyssey series (excluding the Magnavox Odyssey 2), the Atari Home Pong, the Coleco Telstar series and the Color TV-Game series. 
	The generation ended with the Computer TV-Game in 1980, but many manufacturers had left the market prior due to the market decline in the year of 1977 and the start of the second 
	generation of video game consoles. </p>

	<h1> Magnavox Odyssey </h1>

	<h1> Pong </h1> 
	<p> After the success of Pong, Bushnell pushed his employees to create new products. A new electronic technology, the large-scale integration (LSI) chip, had recently become available, which Bushnell believed would
	allow pioneering in new game concepts. Atari began working on the reduction of Pong from a large arcade printed circuit board (PCB) down to a small LSI chip for use in a home system. 
	The initial development cost for a game on a single LSI chip was expensive, costing around $50,000 (equivalent to $335,000 in 2021), 
	but once the chip was developed, it became significantly cheaper to mass-produce the game as well as more difficult to reverse-engineer. </p>

	<h1> Coleco Telstar </h1>
	<p> The Coleco Telstar brand is a series of dedicated first-generation home video game consoles produced, released and marketed by Coleco from 1976 to 1978. 
	Starting with Coleco Telstar Pong clone based video game console on General Instrument's AY-3-8500 chip in 1976, there were 14 consoles released in the Coleco Telstar series. 
	About one million units of the first model called Coleco Telstar were sold. The large product lineup and the impending fading out of the Pong machines led Coleco to face near-bankruptcy in 1980.</p>
