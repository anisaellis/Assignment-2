	<h1> Second Generation</h1>
	<p> In the history of video games, the second generation era refers to computer and video games, video game consoles, and handheld video game consoles available from 1976 to 1982 
	Notable platforms of the second generation include the Fairchild Channel F, Atari 2600, Intellivision, and ColecoVision. The generation began in November 1976 with the release of 
	the Fairchild Channel F. This was followed by the Atari 2600 in 1977, Intellivision in 1980 and then the ColecoVision in 1982. By the end of the era, there were over 15 
	different consoles. </p>

	<h1> Fairchild Channel F</h1>
	
	<p> The Fairchild Channel F, short for Channel Fun, is a video game console, the first to be based on a microprocessor and to use ROM cartridges instead of having games built-in.
	It was released by Fairchild Camera and Instrument in November 1976 across North America at a retail price of US$169.95 (equivalent to $810 in 2021). It was launched as the 
	Video Entertainment System, but when Atari released its Video Computer System the next year, Fairchild rebranded their machine as Channel F while keeping the Video Entertainment System descriptor. </p>

	and investors, eventually becoming INTV Corporation. Intellivision discontined 1990 after 3 million sells. </p>
